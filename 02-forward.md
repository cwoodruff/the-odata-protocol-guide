# This Is an A-Head

Congratulations on starting your new project! We've added some skeleton files for you, to help you get started, but you can delete any or all of them, as you like. In the file called chapter.html, we've added some placeholder content showing you how to markup and use some basic book elements, like notes, sidebars, and figures.
